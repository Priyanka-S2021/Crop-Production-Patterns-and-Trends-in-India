**"Exploring Trends and Patterns in Crop Production Across India: Insights, Visualizations, and Analytical Predictions"**


**Project Overview**

This project analyzes crop production data across various states in India, focusing on the production of different crops across various seasons. The analysis utilizes Python libraries like Pandas, Geopandas, and Matplotlib to process the data and generate insightful visualizations.


**Data Analyzed**

1.	Dataset:
o	Contains crop production data for various states in India, including fields like: 
	State: The name of the state.
	Crop: The name of the crop.
	Season: The crop season (e.g., Winter, Summer, Monsoon, Whole Year).
	Crop_Year: The year in which the crop was produced.
	Area: The area in hectares where the crop was grown.
	Production: The total production of the crop in metric tons.
	Yield: The yield per hectare.
2.	GeoJSON:
o	Provides the geographical boundaries of states in India.


**Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**

1.	Handling Missing Data:
o	Null Value Removal: 
	Rows containing null or missing values were removed to ensure data consistency and integrity during analysis.
o	Median Calculation: 
	For columns with missing values that could not be removed (e.g., due to incomplete data entries), the median was calculated and used to fill in the missing values, ensuring that the dataset was complete for analysis.
	The median was selected because it is less sensitive to outliers compared to the mean.
2.	Filtering Data:
o	The dataset was filtered based on different seasons (e.g., Winter, Summer, Monsoon, Whole Year) to analyze crop production during specific periods.
3.	Data Aggregation:
o	Grouping the dataset by State and Crop to calculate the total crop production by state for each season.
o	Aggregating production data by crop and state to identify top crops by production.
4.	Data Merging:
o	Merging crop production data with GeoJSON data to create a map of production by state.


**Key Outputs and Visualizations**

1.	Choropleth Map (Static):
o	Static choropleth maps were created using Matplotlib and Geopandas to visualize crop production across states. These maps show: 
	The production levels of different crops by state.
	Production data for each season.
2.	Top 10 Crops by Production:
o	For each season, the top 10 crops by production were identified and visualized using Matplotlib bar charts.
o	These charts display the crops with the highest production values in a given season.
3.	Seasonal Comparison:
o	Static maps and bar charts were created to compare crop production across seasons using Matplotlib.
o	The maps are designed to show how crop production changes across different states for each season.

**Tools and Libraries Used**

•	Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis (grouping, filtering, sorting).
•	Geopandas: Geospatial data handling and merging for choropleth maps.
•	Matplotlib: For static visualizations (bar charts, choropleth maps, and seasonal comparisons).
